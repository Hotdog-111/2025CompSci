# 1. Open the 'records.txt' file in read mode
# 2. Populate a 2D list of records to hold the information (remember to strip new lines etc)
# 3. Print the contents in a nice format e.g.
# Record1: Bill Williams, age: 60, sport: football
# 4. Add a filter so that only those under an age inputted by the user are printed
# 4. In your 2D list, replace the 'RecordX' field with just a number e.g.
# e.g. Record1,Bill,Williams,60,football becomes 1,Bill,Williams,60,football
