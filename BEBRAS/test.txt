Introduction
For a range of numbers, the “sum of even numbers” is calculated by adding up all the even numbers in the range.

For example, if the range is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, the sum of even numbers is 6 + 8 + 10 = 24.

Task
Write a program that calculates and outputs the sum of even numbers for a given range.

Input format
A string containing two numbers separated by a space. These numbers define the start and end of the range. The numbers will be whole numbers and can be negative or positive. The lowest number will always come first.

Output format
Output a number representing the sum of even numbers in the range.

Example
Input
2 10
Output
30

Introduction
A student is trying to improve their physical fitness and exercises every day. Each day, he records the length of his exercise session. He also tracks his “streaks”, which represent consecutive days where he exercised for at least as long as the previous day. When a streak is broken, the streak count resets to 1.

Task
Write a program that takes a sequence of numbers as input, where each number represents the total exercise time (in minutes) for the day. The program should determine the longest consecutive streak of days during which the workout time was the same as or more than the previous day’s workout time. A new streak starts from day 1.

Input format
A string containing a list of numbers separated by spaces. Each number represents the total exercise time (in minutes) for a day.

Output format
Output a single number representing the longest consecutive streak of days where the workout time met or exceeded the workout time of the previous day.

Example
Input
70 80 90 95 85 75 100 105 110 90 95
Output
4
